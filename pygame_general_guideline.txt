PYGAME Module guidelines

0) surface is a screen object. A surface in Pygame is a part of the screen where you display a game element.

1) when choosing artwork for your games, be sure to pay attention to licensing. The safest and cheapest way to start is to use freely licensed 
graphics that you can modify from a website like http://pixabay.com/. You can use almost any type of image, but the easiest way is to use a 
bitmap (.bmp) file because Pygame loads bitmaps by default. Tools to convert other type of images to bitmap are eg. Photoshop, GIMP or Paint.

2) - To center a game element one can use: center, centerx or centery attributes of a rect. 
   - To work with edges: top, bottom, left or right attributes
   - Adjusting horizontal or vertical placement of a surface: x or y coordinates (coordinates of top-left corner of a rect)
   - In Pygame, the origin (0, 0) is at the top-left corner of the screen and coordinates increase as you go down and to the right
